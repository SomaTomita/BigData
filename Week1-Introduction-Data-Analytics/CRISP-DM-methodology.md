# CRISP-DM: Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining

## Overview

CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) is a comprehensive framework for managing data mining projects across industries. It provides a structured yet flexible approach to guide data science projects from initial business understanding to final deployment. This methodology has become the de facto standard for developing data mining and predictive analytics solutions.

The framework is designed to be:

- Industry-agnostic
- Technology-neutral
- Adaptable to different project sizes
- Iterative and cyclical
- Focused on practical application
