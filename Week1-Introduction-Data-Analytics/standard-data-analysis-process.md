# Standard Data Analysis Process: A Practical Guide

## Overview

This document outlines a systematic approach to data analysis, demonstrated through a practical research task comparing countries' populations and economic activities.

## The Data Analysis Process

### Step 1: Setting Research Goals

- Start with a clear research topic
- Formulate specific research questions
- Example topic: "Analyzing relationships between country populations and economic activity"
- Potential research questions:
  - What is a "typical" country in terms of population and economic activity?
  - Is there a correlation between population size and economic activity?
  - How do countries cluster when comparing these metrics?

### Step 2: Data Acquisition

- Collect relevant data (minimum 10 countries)
- Data sources should include:
  - Population figures
  - Economic indicators (e.g., GDP)
- Initial data exploration using visualization tools
- Time constraint: ~10 minutes for initial data gathering

### Step 3: Data Cleaning

Checklist for data quality:

1. Identify and handle missing values
2. Data type verification
   - Convert text to numbers where appropriate
   - Standardize formats
3. Remove unwanted characters
   - Eliminate leading/trailing spaces
   - Fix punctuation issues
4. Validate data ranges
   - Check for implausible values
   - Verify population limits (e.g., < 2 billion)

### Step 4: Analysis

Quantitative analysis using statistical functions:

- Descriptive statistics
  - Mean, median, mode
  - Standard deviation
  - Range
- Correlation analysis
- Regression analysis (if appropriate)
- Use of Google Sheets statistical functions for calculations

### Step 5: Evaluation

Assessment criteria:

- Reliability of results
- Validity of conclusions
- Business decision applicability
- Limitations of the analysis
- Potential biases

### Step 6: Presentation

Key elements of result presentation:

- Clear documentation of process
- Explanation of methodology
- Visual representation of findings
- Clean, organized spreadsheet
- Logical flow of information

## Best Practices

1. **Documentation**

   - Record all data sources
   - Document cleaning steps
   - Note assumptions made
   - Explain methodological choices

2. **Analysis**

   - Use appropriate statistical tools
   - Validate results
   - Consider alternative approaches
   - Account for limitations

3. **Presentation**
