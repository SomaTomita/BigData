# Case Study: Digital Analysis of Human Impact on Wildlife

## Overview

A groundbreaking study analyzing 674,320 digitized records from 94 wildlife rehabilitation centers across the U.S. and Canada (2011-2019) reveals patterns of human impact on wildlife and suggests strategies for reducing harm to wild animals.

## Research Methodology

### Data Collection

- 674,320 case records analyzed
- 94 wildlife rehabilitation centers
- Time period: 2011-2019
- Coverage: U.S. and Canada
- Over 1,000 species studied

### Data Transformation

- Transition from physical to digital records
- Implementation of WILD-ONe database
- Standardized documentation of:
  - Animal condition
  - Cause of injury/illness
  - Treatment plans
  - Outcomes

## Key Findings

### 1. Primary Causes of Wildlife Injury

- Vehicle collisions (12% of cases)
- Building/window collisions
- Power line/wind turbine impacts
- Domestic pet attacks
- Toxic substance exposure
- Climate-related incidents

### 2. Species-Specific Impacts

- Great Horned Owls: Primarily vehicle collisions
- Big Brown Bats: Mainly window collisions
- Kemp's Ridley Sea Turtles: Fishing-related incidents
- Bald Eagles: Lead poisoning from ammunition

### 3. Treatment Outcomes

- Overall release rate: ~33%
- Species-specific success rates:
  - Brown Pelicans: 68% released
  - Bald Eagles: 20% released
- Mortality/euthanization rate: ~60%

### 4. Environmental Factors

- Climate change impacts observed
- Increased admissions during extreme weather
- Regional variations in injury patterns
- Habitat destruction effects

## Recommended Solutions

### Infrastructure Improvements

- Wildlife crossings (bridges/underpasses)
- Window modifications
- Alternative power line designs

### Policy Changes

- Restrictions on lead ammunition
- Wildlife-inclusive disaster planning
- Enhanced habitat protection

### Individual Actions

- Reduced driving speeds
- Non-lead fishing/hunting gear
- Window decals installation
- Support for rehabilitation centers

## Significance

The study demonstrates how digitized wildlife rehabilitation records can:

- Track patterns of human impact on wildlife
- Inform conservation strategies
- Guide policy decisions
- Improve wildlife protection measures

## Conclusion

While the scale of human impact on wildlife is substantial, the study provides clear evidence-based solutions for reducing harm. The digitization of records enables better tracking and more effective conservation strategies.
