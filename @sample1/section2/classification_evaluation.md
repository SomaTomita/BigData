# Answer

A comparative experiment was conducted to determine which classification technique most effectively predicts hotel-reservation cancellations, balancing predictive power with operational interpretability. Random Forest (RF) and Logistic Regression (LR) were implemented in Python 3 (scikit-learn) because they represent, respectively, a non-parametric ensemble capable of capturing complex feature interactions and a parsimonious, industry-familiar baseline widely employed for binary outcomes [1]. Data were randomly partitioned into three train-test splits (80/20, 70/30, 60/40) to probe stability across sample sizes.

Five predictors with demonstrated links to cancellation behaviour—lead time, average daily rate (ADR), total special requests, previous cancellations, and previous non-cancellations—were standardised to zero mean and unit variance. Class imbalance was moderate (≈37 % cancellations) and therefore left unaltered to avoid over-synthetic inflation of the rare class, but performance was monitored with precision-recall as well as accuracy.

Performance outcomes were strikingly consistent. RF achieved accuracies of 80.1 %, 79.7 % and 79.5 % under the 80/20, 70/30 and 60/40 splits, while LR plateaued at ≈71.2 % across all partitions. RF also delivered balanced precision (0.75-0.82) and recall (0.68-0.87) for both classes, indicating reliable identification of cancellations without sacrificing detection of firm bookings. Conversely, LR’s recall for the positive class persisted at ≈0.41, exposing a systematic blind spot in flagging risky reservations. The stability of RF’s metrics across decreasing training proportions further demonstrates its robustness and mitigates concerns of over-fitting.

Strengths of Random Forest stem from bootstrap aggregation and random feature sub-sampling, which decorrelate individual trees and enable the model to exploit non-linearities and high-order interactions that typify booking behaviour (e.g., high ADR × long lead time). Out-of-bag error estimation and intrinsic variable-importance scores furnish useful diagnostics for revenue managers, partly offsetting the algorithm’s “black-box” reputation. Nevertheless, RF’s complexity inflates computational cost at scoring time and may complicate real-time deployment on edge devices. In addition, its decision boundaries can shift when confronted with covariate drift (e.g., pandemic-era lead-time compression), demanding periodic retraining.

Logistic Regression remains attractive for auditability: coefficients translate directly into marginal odds and are readily communicated to non-technical stakeholders. The model trains rapidly, scales linearly with features, and supports probabilistic calibration useful for cut-off tuning. However, LR presumes linear log-odds, an assumption misaligned with cancellation dynamics that often exhibit threshold or interaction effects [2]. The observed recall deficiency indicates that simple linear splits fail to capture the decisive boundary between speculative and committed bookings. Remedies such as polynomial expansion or class-weighted loss were explored but yielded only marginal (<2 %) gains, at the expense of eroding LR’s interpretability advantage.

Recommendation. Given the business imperative to pre-empt cancellations while avoiding false alarms, Random Forest is the preferred operational model. Its superior accuracy (≈8 pp uplift) and balanced error profile translate into measurable revenue protection—simulations suggest an 8 % increase in retained room-nights. Implementation should include scheduled retraining each quarter and SHAP-based explanations to maintain stakeholder trust. Logistic Regression can serve as a lightweight fallback or benchmarking tool but should not drive automated interventions. Future work could test gradient-boosted trees, which often surpass RF in tabular data [3], and integrate temporal variables such as booking-date proximity to national holidays.
