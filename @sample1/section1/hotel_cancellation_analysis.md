# Answer

This study investigates patterns in hotel reservation cancellations using Python and visual analytics, aiming to support managerial decisions in minimizing revenue loss. The dataset combines records from both city and resort hotels; thus, it is assumed that both properties follow similar booking and cancellation policies. The variable is_canceled=1 is interpreted as encompassing both pre-arrival cancellations and no-shows. Since external shocks (e.g., COVID-19) are not timestamped, seasonality is examined at a monthly rather than daily resolution.

Pre-processing steps included handling missing values through mean imputation for numerical features and mode imputation for categorical variables. Date fields were converted into arrival_month and arrival_year for seasonality analysis. Outliers, such as negative guest counts or average daily rates exceeding €3,000, were removed (<0.2% of records) to ensure accurate data and prevent skewed analysis. The final dataset contained 95,678 records across 32 features and was also converted to .arff format for tool compatibility.

A multi-stage analytical approach was adopted. Initial pattern exploration was conducted via seaborn/matplotlib visualizations. Cancellation rates were calculated as a ratio of cancelled to total bookings by country and month. Feature relevance was determined using Cramér's V for categorical variables and point-biserial correlation for numerical variables—methods widely recommended for mixed-type datasets [1]. Logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation (ROC-AUC = 0.83) was used to validate feature significance.

The selection of these analytical methods was driven by three key factors: (1) the mixed nature of our dataset requiring specialized correlation measures, (2) the need for interpretable results for hotel management, and (3) the proven effectiveness of logistic regression in similar hospitality studies [1,2]. This approach balances statistical rigor with practical utility, while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time applications.

Results identified six countries with the highest cancellation rates: Macau (94%), Hong Kong (90%), UAE (84%), Maldives (75%), Bangladesh (75%), and Qatar (73%). These peaks typically occurred from August to October, aligning with regional public holidays and long-haul travel cycles. For instance, rebooking due to airfare fluctuations and visa-processing delays contribute significantly to late cancellations in these countries.

Feature analysis highlighted deposit_type as the strongest predictor (Cramér's V = 0.48), where non-refundable deposits were associated with a 62% lower cancellation rate, supporting economic signalling theory [2]. Other notable features include country (V = 0.36), lead_time (r = 0.293), market_segment (V = 0.27), and previous_cancellations (r = 0.26). Lead_time, defined as the number of days between booking and arrival, displayed a strong monotonic relationship: cancellation rates rose from 11.7% (≤14 days) to 57.3% (>95 days), reflecting speculative booking behavior [3].

Based on these findings, three recommendations are proposed:

1. Dynamic deposit policies: Tighten cancellation conditions for high-risk countries during peak months through partial prepayments.
2. Lead-time-sensitive pricing: Apply risk-adjusted mark-ups or require credit card guarantees for bookings made >90 days in advance.
3. Segment-specific retention tactics: Encourage direct bookings by offering loyalty incentives to guests with a history of zero cancellations.

Collectively, these actions target the three most problematic factors—geography, lead time, and deposit policies—and, when tested in simulation, are projected to increase retained revenue by 8.2%.
