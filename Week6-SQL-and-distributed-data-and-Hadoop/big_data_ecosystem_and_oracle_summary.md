# Key Challenges in Big Data Processing

### Three Fundamental Questions:

1. The physical limits of our computer – if the data is too large to fit into the memory we have, will our approach to the problem still work?
2. The computational complexity of our algorithm – as the volume of our data increases, does the time taken increase more quickly so a solution becomes impossible in a reasonable time?
3. The structure of our computer – is it designed to be efficient in handling big data, where we will spend much more time moving data around than processing it?

### Detailed Analysis of Each Challenge:

#### 1. Physical Limitations of Computer Memory

When data becomes too large to fit into a computer's memory, traditional data processing tools and methods cannot easily manage or analyze data of this scale. Big data is defined as containing structured and unstructured data that is too large to be processed using conventional database and software technologies.

When facing such physical limitations, a paradigm shift from traditional host and service-centric models to data-centric architecture and operational models is necessary. The sources suggest the following effective approaches:

- Adoption of Distributed Storage and Computing: When data exceeds the physical limits of a single system, "All Data" infrastructure must adopt universally distributed storage and computing.
- Cloud-based Infrastructure: Data storage solutions can use cloud, on-premises, or both, allowing data storage in any format and bringing processing requirements and process engines to datasets as needed.
- Utilization of Data Lakes: Data lakes are gaining popularity as they support current computing requirements and can spin up resources as needed.

These approaches enable problem-solving even when data exceeds a single computer's memory or storage capacity through distributed processing and flexible resource provisioning.

#### 2. Computational Complexity of Algorithms

As data volume increases, especially with high velocity, traditional data processing tools may struggle to process it within a reasonable timeframe. Big data requires cost-effective and innovative forms of information processing (analytics) due to its high volume, velocity, and variety.

To address concerns about traditional algorithms and approaches becoming impractical as data volume increases, the sources present these solutions:

- Introduction of New Analytics Methods: Big data requires new analytical approaches such as real-time/streaming analytics, interactive analytics, and machine learning analytics.
- Utilization of Parallel Processing: Open-source frameworks like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark were developed to facilitate big data set processing and reduce storage costs.
- High-Performance Analytics Infrastructure: Big Data Analytics Infrastructure (BDAI) includes cluster services, Hadoop-related services and tools, and MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) databases.

These technologies are designed to manage computational complexity and maintain reasonable solution times, overcoming the limitations of traditional single-threaded processing and inefficient algorithms.

#### 3. Computer Structure and Data Movement

Traditional IT and communication technologies are OS/system-based and host/service-centric, meaning all communication or processing is coupled to hosts/computers running application software. This design creates numerous problems when data needs to move between systems or domains, or when operated in a distributed manner.

Big data recognizes this data movement inefficiency as a challenge and demands different structures:

- Transition to Data-Centric Models: Big data requires different data-centric operational models and protocols. The Big Data Ecosystem (BDE) contrasts with traditional architecture due to its data-centric characteristics.
- Integration of Distributed Storage and Computing: "All Data" infrastructure must adopt universally distributed storage and computing, providing complex functionality (depicted as data buses) to handle data exchange and process distribution/synchronization.
- Co-location of Data and Processing: Storage solutions can use cloud, on-premises, or both, storing data in any format and bringing necessary processing requirements and process engines to datasets on demand. This supports the concept of "moving computing to data" rather than moving data.

In conclusion, traditional computer structures are not designed to handle big data efficiently, leading to excessive time spent on data movement. Therefore, structural changes toward data-centric, distributed infrastructure are essential to meet big data requirements.
