# Disinformation and 'Fake News': Analysis of the Interim Report

This report focuses on data misuse and targeting issues specifically involving **Facebook, GSR, Cambridge Analytica, and Aggregate IQ (AIQ)**.

> **Key Terms:**
>
> - **Microtargeting**: A marketing strategy that uses consumer data and demographics to identify specific audiences' interests, enabling precise targeting of messages.
> - **Data Scraping**: The automated process of extracting data from websites or applications, often without explicit permission.
> - **Psychological Profiling**: The practice of analyzing individuals' personality traits and behaviors to predict their actions and preferences.

## Cambridge Analytica:

- Established in 2012 with Robert Mercer's support, specializing in data targeting and communication campaigns primarily for Republican candidates in the US
- Utilized "OCEAN psychological analysis" methodology (also known as the "Big Five" personality traits) to adjust messages based on voters' psychological characteristics, attempting to influence voting behavior by appealing to specific emotions
  > **OCEAN Analysis**: Stands for Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism - a framework used to assess personality traits
- Initially denied using Facebook data, but later acknowledged contradictions in testimony and misleading the committee

## Global Science Research (GSR):

- Founded in 2014 by Cambridge University researcher Alexander Kogan, who developed the GSR app (later renamed to "thisisyourdigitallife")
- The app collected data about users and their friends without friends' knowledge or explicit consent
  > **Digital Footprint**: The trail of data that users leave behind while using digital services, including likes, shares, and personal information
- Dr. Kogan believed this data collection and analysis method would be valuable for digital campaign audience targeting, leading to collaboration with SCL Elections and Cambridge Analytica
- Dr. Kogan acknowledged that this data "scraping" violated Facebook's terms of service
- Christopher Wylie stated that data obtained from the GSR app became Cambridge Analytica's **"foundational dataset"**

## Facebook:

- The root cause of the data breach was the "Friends permissions" feature (2010-2014), which allowed developers to access friends' data
  > **API Permissions**: Rules that control what data third-party applications can access from a platform
- Facebook lost control and oversight of data once it was transferred from their servers to developers
- Facebook accused Dr. Kogan of violating terms of service and characterized his activities as "fraud"
- The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) indicated intention to fine Facebook Â£500,000 for lack of transparency and security issues
  > **ICO**: UK's independent authority set up to uphold information rights in the public interest
- Similar to the Cambridge Analytica case, Facebook recently suspended another company (Crimson Hexagon) for suspected data collection through contracts with the US government and Kremlin-linked organizations

## Aggregate IQ (AIQ):

- Canadian company that developed "Ripon," a political customer management software for SCL
  > **CRM Software**: Customer Relationship Management software used to manage interactions with current and potential customers/voters
- Christopher Wylie testified that "Ripon" utilized algorithms derived from Facebook data
- ICO confirmed AIQ's access to UK voters' personal data and is investigating data retention
- AIQ used tools capable of "scraping" contact information and other data from LinkedIn user profiles
- Involved with the "uCampaign" app used in Donald Trump's election campaign and the EU exit campaign, which shared users' contact information with third parties for microtargeting

## SCL Group and Complex Relationships:

- Cambridge Analytica emerged from SCL Consulting, which originally applied military-developed specialized communication techniques to political campaigns
  > **Military Communication Techniques**: Strategic communication methods developed for psychological operations and influence campaigns
- Alexander Nix denied clear distinction between SCL and Cambridge Analytica; the committee expressed concerns about complex corporate relationships and shareholder structure
- Emerdata Limited was established as the ultimate holding company, with Robert Mercer's daughters and Eric Prince (founder of private military company Blackwater USA) serving as directors
  > **Holding Company**: A company created to own and control other companies, often used to establish corporate control with minimal investment
- Concerns were raised about laptop theft and Emerdata being a major creditor during SCL Elections Ltd's bankruptcy proceedings, leading to recommendations for investigation by the UK National Crime Agency (NCA)

## Summary

This report details how personal data was collected without consent and used for psychological profiling and microtargeting to influence voter decision-making. It highlights the complex relationships between involved companies (Cambridge Analytica, GSR, Facebook, AIQ, SCL) and concerns about their lack of transparency. The report particularly emphasizes Facebook's fundamental flaws in data protection and transparency, as well as the dishonesty of involved parties in information disclosure.

> **Impact on Democracy**: This case demonstrates how modern data analytics and psychological profiling techniques can be used to influence democratic processes, raising serious concerns about election integrity and personal privacy in the digital age.
