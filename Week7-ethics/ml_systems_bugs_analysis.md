   - High severity bugs often fixed faster
   - Lower severity bugs can have longer resolution times
   - Suggests prioritization affects fix speed

### Implications for ML System Development

1. **Resource Allocation**

   - Plan for longer resolution times in algorithmic issues
   - Allocate more resources for timing/optimization bugs
   - Expect wider system impact from algorithm changes

2. **Testing Strategy**

   - Focus on algorithm/method testing

3. **Development Process**
   - Build in time for multiple revision cycles
   - Prioritize based on both severity and complexity
   - Consider file impact in change management

These statistics provide valuable insights for ML system development teams, helping in resource allocation, planning, and risk management. The data suggests that while most bugs can be resolved relatively quickly, certain categories consistently require more time and effort, particularly those related to core algorithms and system optimization.
